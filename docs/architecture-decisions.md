# Architecture Decision Records

This document tracks key technical and architectural decisions made during the development of the Twisdom project. Each decision is recorded with context, alternatives considered, and implications.

## ADR-001: Client-Side Architecture for MVP

**Date:** 2025-03-04  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** The initial MVP implementation of Twisdom needs to provide bookmark management functionality with minimal infrastructure requirements.

**Decision:** Implement Twisdom as a client-side only application using React, TypeScript, and localStorage for data persistence.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Full-stack application with backend database
2. Progressive Web App with IndexedDB
3. Electron desktop application

**Implications:**
- **Positive:** Simplifies deployment, reduces infrastructure costs, enables rapid development
- **Negative:** Limited storage capacity (~5MB), no multi-device sync, security concerns with API keys
- **Constraints:** Maximum number of bookmarks limited by localStorage capacity
- **Future Impact:** Will require architectural changes for scaling beyond MVP

## ADR-002: Centralized State Management with React useState

**Date:** 2025-03-04  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** The application needs a state management approach that balances simplicity with functionality for the MVP phase.

**Decision:** Use React's built-in useState hook with a centralized state object (BookmarkStore) and prop drilling for state distribution.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Redux for global state management
2. React Context API with useReducer
3. Zustand or other lightweight state management libraries

**Implications:**
- **Positive:** Simplifies implementation, reduces dependencies, easier debugging
- **Negative:** Prop drilling can become unwieldy as the application grows
- **Constraints:** Performance impact with large state objects and frequent updates
- **Future Impact:** May need refactoring to Context API or Redux as complexity increases

## ADR-003: OpenAI Integration for Content Analysis

**Date:** 2025-03-04  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** The application needs intelligent content analysis capabilities to enhance the bookmark management experience.

**Decision:** Integrate with OpenAI's API using the GPT-4 model for content analysis, summarization, and recommendations.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Local machine learning models
2. Custom NLP pipeline
3. Other AI service providers

**Implications:**
- **Positive:** High-quality analysis with minimal development effort
- **Negative:** API costs, dependency on external service, latency
- **Constraints:** Rate limits, cost considerations for heavy usage
- **Future Impact:** May need to implement caching or batching strategies for cost optimization

## ADR-004: CSV Import for Twitter Bookmarks

**Date:** 2025-03-04  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** Users need a way to import their Twitter bookmarks into the application.

**Decision:** Implement CSV import functionality using PapaParse library.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Direct Twitter API integration
2. JSON import format
3. Manual bookmark creation

**Implications:**
- **Positive:** Simple implementation, flexible format
- **Negative:** Requires users to export bookmarks from Twitter first
- **Constraints:** Limited by CSV format capabilities
- **Future Impact:** May add direct API integration in future phases

## ADR-005: Tailwind CSS for Styling

**Date:** 2025-03-04  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** The application needs a styling approach that enables rapid development and consistent design.

**Decision:** Use Tailwind CSS for styling with dark mode support.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. CSS Modules
2. Styled Components
3. Material UI or other component libraries

**Implications:**
- **Positive:** Rapid development, consistent design system, built-in dark mode
- **Negative:** Verbose class names, learning curve
- **Constraints:** Design limited by Tailwind's utility-first approach
- **Future Impact:** May need to implement custom design system as the application matures

## ADR-006: Documentation-First Development Approach

**Date:** 2025-03-04  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** The project needs a systematic approach to preserve knowledge and context across development sessions.

**Decision:** Implement a comprehensive documentation system with PRD, session logs, architecture decisions, and issue tracking.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Traditional project management tools
2. Minimal documentation with code comments
3. Wiki-based documentation

**Implications:**
- **Positive:** Knowledge preservation, improved onboarding, reduced context loss
- **Negative:** Maintenance overhead
- **Constraints:** Requires discipline to maintain
- **Future Impact:** Will facilitate scaling the development team and project complexity

## ADR-007: Supabase Integration for Backend Services

**Date:** 2025-03-04  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** The application needs to address limitations of the client-side only architecture, particularly around data persistence, authentication, and multi-device synchronization.

**Decision:** Integrate Supabase as the backend service provider for the Twisdom application.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Custom backend with Express.js and MongoDB
2. Firebase
3. AWS Amplify
4. Appwrite

**Implications:**
- **Positive:**
  - PostgreSQL database provides robust data storage beyond localStorage limits
  - Built-in authentication system with multiple providers
  - Row-level security for data protection
  - Real-time subscriptions for live updates
  - Storage service for media files
  - GraphQL and REST API endpoints
  - Local development environment with Docker

- **Negative:**
  - Learning curve for Supabase-specific features
  - Dependency on external service
  - Potential migration complexity from localStorage

- **Constraints:**
  - PostgreSQL limitations compared to NoSQL for certain use cases
  - Free tier limitations for production use

- **Future Impact:**
  - Enables multi-device synchronization
  - Provides foundation for collaborative features
  - Improves security by moving API keys to server-side
  - Facilitates future scaling of the application
