# Next Session Context

Twisdom now has a robust backend implementation using Supabase, with PostgreSQL database, authentication, and data synchronization capabilities. The application can now store data securely in the cloud, enabling multi-device access and removing localStorage limitations. Users can create accounts, sign in, and migrate their existing data to the cloud. The next development session should focus on moving the OpenAI API calls to Supabase Edge Functions to improve security, implementing real-time subscriptions for live updates, and adding pagination for improved performance with large datasets.

## Key Components

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Authentication, Storage)
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 for content analysis
- **Data Storage**: Hybrid approach (Supabase when authenticated, localStorage when not)
- **Authentication**: Email/password via Supabase Auth

## Current Status

- **Supabase Integration**: Completed
- **Authentication**: Implemented
- **Data Migration**: Utility created
- **Multi-Device Sync**: Enabled through Supabase
- **Security**: Improved but OpenAI API key still exposed

## Priority Tasks

1. AI Analayais should generate tags on the card and on the tags page
2. get collections working
3. implement reading queue
4. links should be autoextracted and given context on linlks page when AI Analyis runs
5. get find similiar working
6. move tag visualiztoion to bottom of page under tagging
7. get AI tagging working


## Technical Debt

- Limited error handling for network failures
- No automated tests for Supabase integration
- Performance optimizations needed for large datasets
