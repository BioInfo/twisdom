# Next Session Context

Twisdom now has a robust backend implementation using Supabase, with PostgreSQL database, authentication, and data synchronization capabilities. The application can now store data securely in the cloud, enabling multi-device access and removing localStorage limitations. Users can create accounts, sign in, and migrate their existing data to the cloud. All AI-powered features have been implemented, including tag generation, link extraction with context, and finding similar bookmarks.

## Key Components

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Authentication, Storage)
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 for content analysis
- **Data Storage**: Hybrid approach (Supabase when authenticated, localStorage when not)
- **Authentication**: Email/password via Supabase Auth
- **Real-time Persistence**: Immediate data saving to Supabase

## Current Status

- **Supabase Integration**: Completed
- **Authentication**: Implemented and fixed
- **Data Migration**: Utility created
- **Multi-Device Sync**: Enabled through Supabase
- **Security**: Improved but OpenAI API key still exposed
- **AI Analysis**: Generating tags, extracting links with context
- **Collections**: Fully functional
- **Reading Queue**: Implemented with real-time persistence
- **Tag Visualization**: Moved to bottom of page under tagging
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Multiple layers of deduplication implemented

## Priority Tasks

1. **Move OpenAI API Calls to Supabase Edge Functions**
   - Create Edge Functions for AI analysis
   - Move API keys to server-side
   - Implement proper error handling and retries

2. **Implement Real-time Subscriptions**
   - Set up Supabase real-time subscriptions
   - Enable live updates across devices
   - Implement conflict resolution for concurrent edits

3. **Add Pagination for Large Datasets**
   - Implement pagination for bookmarks list
   - Add infinite scrolling or load-more functionality
   - Optimize queries for better performance

4. **Enhance Error Handling**
   - Add comprehensive error handling for network failures
   - Implement offline mode with sync when online
   - Add user-friendly error messages and recovery options

5. **Implement Automated Testing**
   - Add unit tests for Supabase integration
   - Create end-to-end tests for critical user flows
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

## Technical Debt

- Limited error handling for network failures
- No automated tests for Supabase integration
- Performance optimizations needed for large datasets
- OpenAI API key exposed in client-side code
