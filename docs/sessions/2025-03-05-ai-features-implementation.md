3. **Reading Queue Implementation**
   - Added functionality to add bookmarks to the reading queue
   - Updated BookmarkCard to include a queue menu for adding items to different queue sections
   - Integrated with the existing ReadingQueue component
   - Added immediate database persistence for reading queue changes

4. **Automatic Link Extraction with Context**
   - Enhanced linkExtractor.ts to fetch context for links using AI
   - Updated the extractedLinks type to include context
   - Modified LinksPage to display the context and tags for each link

5. **Find Similar Functionality**
   - Fixed the findSimilarBookmarks function in aiService.ts
   - Ensured proper handling of null values in the API response

6. **Tag Visualization Placement**
   - Modified TagsPage to move the TagHierarchyVisualizer below the tag management section
   - Added a toggle button to show/hide the visualization

7. **AI Tagging**
   - Implemented the handleAddTag function to add AI-suggested tags to bookmarks
   - Updated the UI to display suggested tags with an option to add them
   - Fixed the suggestTags function in aiService.ts

## Database and Infrastructure Improvements

1. **Supabase Project Structure**
   - Created a proper Supabase project structure with the correct directory layout
   - Created two migration files:
     - 20250304_initial_schema.sql: Sets up the base database schema
     - 20250305_add_ai_columns.sql: Adds AI-specific columns and indexes

2. **Real-time Data Persistence**
   - Updated the saveStoreToSupabase function to save AI analysis data
   - Modified the analyzeBookmark function to save results immediately to the database
   - Updated the reading queue handling to persist changes immediately

3. **Authentication and Error Handling**
   - Fixed authentication session handling to prevent page reload requirements
   - Added duplicate bookmark detection and handling in saveStoreToSupabase
   - Implemented a tracking mechanism to avoid processing the same bookmark multiple times
   - Added specific error handling for database constraint violations
   - Added automatic bookmark deduplication in App.tsx to prevent duplicate bookmarks in the UI
   - Improved the bookmark loading logic to properly deduplicate bookmarks

## Technical Challenges Overcome

1. **Database Migration Issues**
   - Fixed issues with the Supabase directory structure
   - Ensured migrations are applied in the correct order
   - Added proper error handling for migration failures

2. **Authentication State Management**
   - Fixed issues with auth state change listeners causing storage access errors
   - Improved the login/logout flow to properly handle user data

3. **Duplicate Data Prevention**
   - Implemented multiple layers of deduplication:
     - When loading data from Supabase
     - When saving data to Supabase
     - In the application state management

## Next Steps

1. **Move OpenAI API Calls to Supabase Edge Functions**
   - Implement Supabase Edge Functions for AI analysis
   - Move API keys to server-side for improved security

2. **Real-time Subscriptions**
   - Implement Supabase real-time subscriptions for live updates
   - Enable multi-device synchronization

3. **Pagination for Large Datasets**
   - Implement pagination for bookmarks, collections, and tags
   - Optimize queries for improved performance

4. **Automated Testing**
   - Add unit tests for Supabase integration
   - Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows

5. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Add more comprehensive error handling for network failures
   - Implement retry mechanisms for transient errors
