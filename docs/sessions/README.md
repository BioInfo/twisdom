# Session Logs

This directory contains chronological logs of development sessions for the Twisdom project. Each session log captures the work completed, decisions made, and context for future sessions.

## Purpose

Session logs serve as a continuous record of the project's evolution, providing:

1. **Historical Context**: Understanding why decisions were made
2. **Knowledge Transfer**: Enabling new team members to understand project history
3. **Progress Tracking**: Documenting incremental progress over time
4. **Context Preservation**: Maintaining context between development sessions

## Session Log Format

Each session log follows a standardized format to ensure consistency and maximize utility:

```markdown
# Session: [YYYY-MM-DD] - [Brief Title]

## Session Goals
- Goal 1
- Goal 2
- Goal 3

## Context
Brief description of the current state of the project and relevant context from previous sessions.

## Work Completed
- Task 1: Description and outcome
- Task 2: Description and outcome
- Task 3: Description and outcome

## Decisions Made
- Decision 1: Rationale and implications
- Decision 2: Rationale and implications

## Technical Notes
- Note 1: Technical details, implementation notes, or observations
- Note 2: Technical details, implementation notes, or observations

## Next Steps
- Task 1: Description and priority
- Task 2: Description and priority
- Task 3: Description and priority

## Issues and Blockers
- Issue 1: Description and potential solutions
- Issue 2: Description and potential solutions

## Next Session Context
Concise summary of the most important information needed for the next development session.
```

## Naming Convention

Session log files follow this naming convention:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-brief-descriptive-title.md
```

Example: `2025-03-04-initial-project-setup.md`

## Automatic Context Bridging

The project implements automatic context bridging between sessions:

1. At the end of each session, a context summary is generated in the "Next Session Context" section
2. At the beginning of the next session, this context is automatically loaded
3. This eliminates manual context transfer between sessions

## Best Practices

When creating session logs:

1. Be specific and detailed about decisions and their rationale
2. Include code snippets for important implementation details
3. Document any unexpected challenges or discoveries
4. Link to relevant external resources or documentation
5. Ensure the "Next Session Context" section contains all critical information
6. Update the active-issues.md file with any new issues discovered
7. Document any architecture decisions in architecture-decisions.md
